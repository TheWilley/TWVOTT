# TWVOTT - The Worse Version Of Text-TV

This is a library to communicate information using a [Text-TV](https://www.svt.se/text-tv/100) alike system. It is currently extremely basic and serves more as a learning experience rather than something one would consider useful. The project name should become self explonatory once you've read the documentation.

Please see the example folder if you're (understandably) confused.

## Installation

You can install the library via NPM:

```bash
npm install twvott
```
